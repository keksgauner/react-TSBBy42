# CONTRIBUTING

## Getting Started

I don't want really say something at the moment ^^

To install do this `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`

### Commits

Commits must look like: \
`<type>(<scope?>): <description>` scope is optional \
`feat(feat): Cookies are eaten` \
Types: `fush, feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, ci, build, revert, types`
