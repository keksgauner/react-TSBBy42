## Contribution

Please read through our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting a pull request. We welcome contributions of all kinds, not just code!

## Further information

Since it is still under **development**, you will have to look in `src` yourself to see what works, e.g., which paths exist.\
You should know the **basics**, such as how to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and use the package manager `pnpm`.

Happy Hacking ^^
